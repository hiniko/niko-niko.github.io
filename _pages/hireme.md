I am _not_ currently looking for work

For over 10 years now I have been learning and hacking about with various languages making small games, websites or music on computers. It&#39;s rather fun.

Whilst I am not looking for any work right now, you are still welcome to contact me should you have a interesting opportunity or something you would like me to help with.

Please see my [CV / Résumé](http://shermanrose.uk/uploads/sherman_rose_general_2016.pdf) for more information.
