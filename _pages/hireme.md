__I am currently looking for work!__

For over 10 years now I have been learning and hacking about with various languages making small games, websites or music on computers. It&#39;s rather fun.

I am looking for the opportunity to work on projects focused on web services with RESTful API&#39;s, responsive web clients or alternative front end consumers, testing based workflows with continuous integration. I am also interested in infrastructure automation and deployment Though any interesting problem gets me excited to learn about.

Plesae see my [CV / Résumé](http://shermanrose.uk/uploads/sherman_rose_general_2016.pdf) for more information.
