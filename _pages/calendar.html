<p> 
This is a canary calendar. If I have arranged to do something with you and you don't see it here, Please get in touch with me.
I am forgettful and badly organised. This isn't an excuse, or me trying to shovel responsibility of timekeeping, organisation and memory on anyone, Just I am so bad at those thigns I may require a poke.
