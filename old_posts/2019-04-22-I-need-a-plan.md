Four months into 2019, two months of being 30. Still no idea what the hell I am doing.
And I think this shows. In my actions, in my attitude, in the lack of energy that really 
needs a laser focus to do anything correctly.

I am on a train agian. These particular thoughs and feelings always happen on a train. 
The physical experience of traveling somewhere also stirs something deep within me.
The noise, the smells, people everywhere. The scenery speeding by from spralling contryside,
to small metropolis. So much of the world passing at once, with so little of it actually 
accessable. I want to close my eyes and disolve into the frame, I want to feel the power in the 
engines, as if it were my own heartbeat. I want to feel the security of the tracks, a known road
guiding me to places I know. As we get faster I feel everything roar in a every rising crecendo 
of furthering pitch and intensity. Then the glide. The engines rest and let inertia take care
of the rest. 

I would love nothing more than to cast this body off and go as a wisp on the wind. That day will come.
But for now I need something more tangable.
